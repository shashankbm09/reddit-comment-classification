There are three ipynb files and 2 dataset files

1)Bernoulli Naive Bayes: In this file we have implemented Bernoulli Naive Bayes. We have commented the code for better understanding. Also, after perforning hyperparameter tunning we have set the parameters accordingly.

2)Text classification algorithms: In this file we have implemented  Logistic Regression,Linear SVM, Multinomial Naive Bayes, MLP Classifier. Hyperparameter are tunned to provide best accuracy.

3)Kaggle competition: In this file we have implemented MLP classifier which was submitted to kaggle competition. Hyperparameter are tunned to provide best accuracy.

4)reddit_train.ccv: contains the training dataset on which the model is trained.

5)reddit_test.csv: contains the test dataset on which our model is evaluated.
